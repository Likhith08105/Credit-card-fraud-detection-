# ðŸ’³ Credit Card Fraud Detection

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project analyzes a **credit card transactions dataset** (from Kaggle) to detect fraudulent activities.  
It demonstrates skills in **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and handling imbalanced datasets**.  
I also implemented baseline ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to evaluate fraud detection performance.

## ðŸš€ Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Removed duplicates, checked missing values
   - Scaled `Amount`, created `Hour` feature from `Time`
   - Bucketized `Amount` into ranges (small/medium/large)

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Class distribution (fraud vs. non-fraud)
   - Amount distribution by fraud status
   - Transactions by hour of the day
   - Correlation analysis of features with fraud

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Created time-based and bucketized features
   - Prepared dataset for modeling

4. **Modeling**
   - Logistic Regression (with class weights)
   - Random Forest (with class weights)
   - ROC-AUC and classification reports

5. **Visualization**
   - Fraud distribution  
   - Amount vs Class (log scale)  
   - Transactions by Hour  
   - Top features correlated with fraud  
   - ROC curves

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights
- Fraud transactions make up only **0.17%** of total â†’ highly imbalanced dataset.  
- Fraud amounts are often **smaller and frequent**, not always large.  
- Certain hours of the day show higher fraud frequency.  
- Logistic Regression and Random Forest achieved strong **ROC-AUC scores (>0.95)**.
